#License:

Any intellectual property right associated with the authorship of

#Dependencies:

This code is designed first and foremost to run on an X-Windows system.
Note it is practical to port the code to Windows/Darwin, but would
require some time and access to one of those platforms.

## All Platforms:
Only `boost`, which you almost certainly have installed anyway. If not,
Linux users can do a command like the following:

    sudo yum install boost          

## Linux:
An `X` server (your display manager), and `cairo` (for processing the
images). Both of these are installed on nearly every modern gnu/linux
distribution straight out of the box.

#Build ScreenGrab:

Cross-platform dependencies:

    Fedora:
    sudo yum install boost-devel    # Development headers

Linux-specific libraries:

    Fedora:
    sudo yum install cairo-devel
    sudo yum groupinstall "X Development Tools"

Similar commands are available for Debian/Ubuntu users.

ScreenGrab uses the `SCons` build system. If it is not already
installed on your system, it is available from the `SCons` website
for your favourite platform, or you can probably just do:

    Fedora:
    sudo yum install scons

You can get a local version of `SCons` which will not need
installing into your system by doing

    ./get-scons

Build is simply:

    cd source/directory/for/ScreenGrab/
    scons

or in the case you are using a local install:
    python ./scons.py

You will find the appropriate binary in ./build

## Build options

Currently, output directory and hot-keys are baked in at build-time.
You can set the output directory by running:

    scons interactive=1

Hotkeys and output directory will in the future be loaded from a config
file.

#Usage:

 * `screengrab &` to run ScreenGrab in the background
 * `ctrl+prtscn` to Capture a screen shot and save to the output dir
   * Grabs are saved under `~/.screengrab/output/`
 * `ctrl+alt+q` to kill the program
