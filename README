#License:

Any intellectual property right associated with the authorship of
the included code are released under the GPLv3.

#Dependencies:

This code is designed to run on an X-Windows system. Nearly every
modern gnu/linux distribution runs with an X-Server and the Cairo
graphics library (which is also a dependency). To compile this
code, you will need to install headers for each of those libraries:

    Fedora:
    sudo yum install cairo-devel
    sudo yum groupinstall "X Development Tools"

You will also need boost modules installed

    Fedora:
    sudo yum install boost          # For users
    sudo yum install boost-devel    # Development headers

Similar commands are available for Debian/Ubuntu users

#Build ScreenGrab:

 * `./autogen.sh` will run Autoconf and friends
 * Move to a build directory
 * `<path to source>/configure`
 * `make`

#Install ScreenGrab:

 * `make install`
 * You can remove it with `make uninstall`

#Usage:

 * `screengrab &` to run ScreenGrab in the background
 * `ctrl+prtscn` to Capture a screen shot and save to the output dir
   * Grabs are saved under `~/.screengrab/output/`
 * `ctrl+alt+q` to kill the program

# Future work:

This program is totally unfinished. Improvements will abound.
